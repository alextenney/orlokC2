## Overview

**[YourProjectName]** is a Command and Control (C2) framework developed during an [AntiSyphon Training](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/) workshop. It combines a Go-based backend for performance and reliability with a sleek, real-time Vue.js frontend.

The framework is designed for red team operators, researchers, and learners who want to explore adversary emulation, implant communication, and C2 infrastructure management.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Agent registration and check-in
- 📡 Secure and customizable tasking/response system
- 📊 Real-time communication via WebSockets
- 🕵️ Implant execution via encrypted channels
